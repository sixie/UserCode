\section{Introduction}
  \label{sec:intro}

\section{Object Selection and Performance}
\label{sec:objects}

The signal events of interest typically contain two high $p_{T}$ photons and two high $p_{T}$ b-jets. 
Photons are selected using a relatively robust cut-based approach, applying requirements on the
electromagnetic shower width, the hadronic to electromagnetic energy ratio, and isolation~\cite{CMS-DP-2013-010}.
The loose working point is used in order to retain as much signal photons as possible. Furthermore, photons are rejected
if an electron is reconstructed within a $\Delta$R cone of $0.1$ to the photon. The efficiency for photons to pass
these selection criteria is evaluated using the GEANT based full simulation of the current Run1 CMS detector, 
and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:photonEfficiency}. The average photon selection efficiency is 
about $85\%$ in the barrel, and about $70\%$ in the endcap. The lower efficiency in the endcap 
is primarily due to the electron veto requirement, which
can be improved in the future. The efficiency for jet-induced fake photons, sometimes referred to as the fake rate,
are also evaluated using the full simulation of QCD dijet samples, and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:photonFakeRate}. 
We note that the average fake rate for photons is about $5 \times 10^{-4}$ for gluon jets and 
about $2\times 10^{-3}$ for quark jets.

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-Kt algorithm with the $D$ parameter equal to $0.5$,
and corrected for pileup effects using the FastJet technique \cite{CMS:2010xta,CMS-DP-2013-011}. Standard CMS 
jet energy corrections are applied up to level 3, correcting for non-uniformities as a function of
pseudorapditiy and $p_{T}$. Jets are tagged as originating from a b-quark by searching for the
presence of secondary vertices. Lifetime information from tracks are also combined to form a 
combined secondary vertex b-tagging discriminator (CSV)~\cite{CMS:BTagPaper,CMS-DP-2013-005}.
The medium working point for the CSV tagger is used. The efficiency for tagging b-jets is 
evaluated using full simulation of the current Run1 CMS detector and shown in
Figure \ref{fig:btagEfficiency}. On average, the b-tagging efficiency is about $70\%$ in the barrel, and
about $55\%$ in the endcap. The mistag rate for light jets and charm jets are also evaluated using
full simulation samples, and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:mistagRate}. The average mistag rate
for light jets is about $1\%$ and for charm jets is about $15\%$.

Electrons and Muons are selected for the purpose of vetoing events with signatures consistent
with Higgs produced in association with a top and anti top quark pair. This process contributes
significantly to the total background after signal event selection requirements. A non-negligble
fraction of such background events contain leptons and can be rejected on this basis. Very loose
selection requirements, denoted as the veto working point, are placed on the 
electron and muon candidates in order to suppress this background as much as possible.
